# PaviaUniversityDataset_A-comparative-study-of-PR-models
Compare multiple PR (Pattern Recognition) algorithms by implementing the classification task on a Remote Sensing dataset.

This is the coursework of the XJTLU pattern recognition course, which I uploaded to help beginners understand and use feature extraction algorithms and pattern recognition algorithms. This code uses PCA+SBS to compare the multiple uses of RF, CNN, KNN models. If you are interested in this, I can provide you with a report essay on this code.
